					<p>My name is Marinie Ben, or Mars for short!</p>

					<p>    I am a Cambodian-American undergraduate 
						student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
						with digital and traditional experience in 
						Architecture and Design. 
					</p>

					<p>    I have background in studio training and 
						professional drawing, as well as both abstract 
						and technical thinking in design.</p>

					<p>My focus on Architecture is the social impact 
						it has on communities, families and individuals 
						across the world. Whether a landmark or a 
						private home, architecture always surrounds 
						us as humans in society. Coming from Cambodia, 
						a third-world country where poverty is prominent,  
						I want to bring sustainable structures that 
						incorporates my art to the world and can be 
						enjoyed by all types of lives.
